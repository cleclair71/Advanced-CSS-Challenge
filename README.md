## About The Project

The purpose of this website is to showcase my work. When the website is loaded, the user should see my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about the developer, their work, and how to contact me. By clicking one of the links in the navigation, the user is taken to the corresponding section of the website. The section about the developer's work includes titled images of their applications, with the first application being larger in size. Clicking on these images will take the user to the deployed application. The website should have a responsive layout that adapts to different screens and devices.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Clicking on the Generate Password button will give you a window prompt that asks you how long you would like your password to be (between 8-128 characters). Once answered, a window confirm will appear asking if you'd like lowercase letters, then uppercase letters, then if you would like to use numbers and lastly, a final window confirm will appear asking if you would like to use special characters. If you have made the appropriate selections within the confines of the criteria, your password will be displayed in the textbox on the screen. If you do not select the appropriate responses, a window alert will appear saying "You must select at least one character type!".
