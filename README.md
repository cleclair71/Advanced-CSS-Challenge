# Portfolio Advanced CSS Challenge

## Description

My aim is to create a webpage from scratch so that the client can display deployed work.

In this starter code I added a variety of  features that meet the Employer's requirements

```
The purpose of this website is to showcase a potential employee's previous work. When the website is loaded, the user should see the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about the developer, their work, and how to contact them. By clicking one of the links in the navigation, the user is taken to the corresponding section of the website. The section about the developer's work includes titled images of their applications, with the first application being larger in size. Clicking on these images will take the user to the deployed application. The website should have a responsive layout that adapts to different screens and devices.

## Installation

Once clicking on the website link, you may navigate through the page and click on links with your mouse.
